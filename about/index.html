	<p>Although young, Ali Isabella has already performed at many of NYC's legendary venues and headlined at two pre-Grammy parties, one honoring Quincy Jones and Stevie Wonder and one for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Ali was an opening act to Reba McEntire and Lonestar, among others, at the world-renowned Wembley Arena in London, England, where she became the youngest ever to appear in that famed venue. 
	<br>
	<br>	
	Ali released her first album, Say You'll Be Mine, in 2012. Her first single, "What If", reached #13 on the Hotdisc Charts in the UK, and her debut single in the US, "New York City Country Girl", reached #14 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales Chart and was #1 for four consecutive weeks on the Billboard Country Hot Singles Sales Chart.
	<br>
	<br>
	Ali was selected for New Music Seminar's Top 100 'Artists on the Verge', appearing regularly with her band in major NYC venues, including Gramercy Theatre, The Studio at Webster Hall, The Bitter End, The Living Room, Cafe Wha?, Rockwood Music Hall, among others, and even at the Naumburg Bandshell in Central Park.
	<br>
	<br>
	Ali's first major television performance in the US was on the top-rated FOX 5 morning show, "Good Day New York", and she has since appeared on many others, including headlining a special at the Hard Rock Café in Foxwoods Casino and showcased in a segment for FUSE News TV. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In 2013, Ali had an impressive lineup of performances including performing a kickoff concert for the March for Babies division of March Of Dimes as a Youth Ambassador and becoming a headline artist at the ASCAP EXPO at the Loews Hollywood Hotel in Los Angeles in April. In May, she was a featured act at the Montauk Music Festival and the headline artist for the Grand Central Station Centennial in NYC. In June, Ali was the featured vocalist at the countrywide arena tour of Cirque Musica - a blend of the world's greatest circus performers together with a fifty-piece symphony orchestra. Through July and August, Ali toured summer camps with Camplified for six weeks and had appeared to over 100,000 people by the end of that summer. At the end of the year, Ali toured and performed in Nashville and Chattanooga, TN. She was also the featured performer at Westchester's Ridge Hill tree lighting ceremony in NY. 
	<br>
	<br>
	In 2014, Ali recorded a collection of beautifully crafted songs and again made headline performances including appearing on the main stage at the Montauk Music Festival for three days, featured on a televised performance from the Gibson Studios in NY, and was honored to be a guest artist for the Duke Ellington 115th Birthday Celebration. Ali was a featured artist at the June 2014 Annual CMA celebrations in Nashville, TN, appearing at an opening night party and twice a day for six days at the legendary Tootsie's Orchid Lounge and Honky Tonk Central. She also headlined at Eastchester's 350th Anniversary celebration and at BMG's fashion week party in NYC. At the end of the year, she was featured at festivals in Nashville, TN, Charlotte, NC, and Gettysburg, PA. 
	<br>
	<br>
	2015 to present, Ali has been busy touring and writing songs for her debut pop EP set to be released in 2016. This past summer, Ali appeared at the Long Island Country Fest and Boston Greenfest. She also toured with the Official Stand Up Tour, traveling to NJ, CT, Dallas and Houston, TX, Little Rock, AR, Cambridge, MA, ending at Gramercy Theatre in New York, NY in August. Recently, she was a featured artist on the High School Nation Tour, joining the tour's Nashville dates with her band, opening for the headliner Drake Bell from Nickelodeon's Drake & Josh.
	<br>
	<br>
	2016 is set to be Ali Isabella's best year yet with a performance at Carnegie Hall on February 4th as part of Lead Belly Fest. Ali will be joining a lineup of artists including Buddy Guy, Eric Burdon, Edgar Winter, Tom Paley, Walter Trout, Dana Fuchs, and others. She will also join the Lead Belly Fest lineup on future dates that will be announced soon. 
	<br>
	<br>
	Ali Isabella's songs and lyrics are special; a songwriting talent that rarely comes along. When you hear her voice, the talent is complete.
